# Weather Data Analysis

## Data Analysis with SQL and Statistical Analysis in Python with Visualisations with Excel

### Description
This repository contains the code, SQL queries, and Python scripts for a comprehensive data analysis project. 
The project involved data extraction, transformation, and statistical analysis using SQL and Python, aiming to derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.

### Introduction
This project is aimed at answering indepth statistical questions concerning the dataset.
SQL was used to clean the data while python was used for statistical analysis as well as to obtaining meaningful insight from the data

### Data Description
The dataset contains information about the customers’ demand rate between 
January 2017 and August 2018. The data were collected on an hourly basis and included
the time data such as date, hour, and season as well as weather data such as the weather 
condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The ‘demand’ column represents the 
customer’s willingness for renting a car for a specific time. Higher demand rates show that 
customers are more willing to rent a car and vice versa.

### SQL Analysis
The version of SQL used in this project is SQLite (solely for the purpose of practice in jupyter notebook)
Some of the SQL keywords used in this project include 
- CREATE TABLE
- DELETE
- INSERT
- ALTER
- UPDATE
- DROP
- SELECT
- WHERE
- CASE statement
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
- LIMIT, among others.

### Statistical Analysis with Python
- Some of the libraries used in this project are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, Kmeans, MLPRegressor, DecisionTreeClassifier, ARIMA, GradientBoostingClassifier, MinMaxScaler, RandomForestRegressor, etc.
- Hypothesis tested:
    - Tests for a significant relationship between each column (except timestamp column) and the demand rate.
